  <h1>Applying for Early Admission to First&nbsp;Grade</h1>

<section class="callout-border-prim smtb-mg">
  <h2>First grade early admission is based on rigorous academic standards</h2>
  <p>The State of Maryland has determined that six years of age is an appropriate age to begin first grade. In many cases, children admitted early to school will be working in a setting with older children. To develop a positive perspective about the school experience, children should feel comfortable, competent, and confident as they learn in the classroom setting. Therefore, <strong>only children who meet rigorous admission standards</strong> will be accepted early into first grade.</p>

  <h3>Testing Requirement</h3>

  <p>Early admission applicants will <strong>be assessed at their prospective school by designated staff in a one-on-one setting between May and July.</strong> Curriculum-based assessment tools will be used to measure their abilities in reading and mathematics in order to ensure their readiness for first grade.</p>

  <p>Children do not need any type of special preparation for the test. Children who already possess the needed skills will have an opportunity to show them during the assessment.</p>

  <h3>Early Admission Factors</h3>

  <p>As stated in the Howard County Public School System <a href="http://www.hcpss.org/f/board/policies/9000.pdf">Policy 9000 (Student Residency, Eligibility, Enrollment and Assignment)</a>, children accepted for early admission must demonstrate a high level of academic, social, emotional, and physical development. </p>

  <p>An assessment of academic skills, as well as a developmental checklist of non-academic competencies, are primary factors for early admission.</p>

</div>

<div class="col-right">
  <h3>Notification of Decision</h3>
  <p>Parents/guardians will be notified by letter from their prospective school regarding the decision of acceptance or denial for early admission. These letters will be mailed following their assessment.</p>
