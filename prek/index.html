  <h3>At-Risk Development Factors</h3>

  <p>As stated in the Howard County Public School System <a href="http://www.hcpss.org/f/board/policies/9000.pdf">Policy 9000 (Student Residency, Eligibility, Enrollment and Assignment)</a>, children accepted for early admission to HCPSS Pre-K must demonstrate a need for early intervention as defined by at-risk developmental factors that critically impact potential success in kindergarten.</p>

  <p>Early admission <strong>does not guarantee that the child will be promoted to the next grade.</strong> Decisions regarding promotion of early admitted Pre-K students to kindergarten are based on performance during the Pre-K year.  </p>
</div>

<div class="col-right">
  <h3>Notification of Decision</h3>
  <p>After reviewing submitted application documents, the Office of Early Childhood Programs will notify parents/guardians of qualification or non-qualification based on income eligibility and based on demonstrated need for early intervention.</p>

  <p>A decision of acceptance or denial for Early Admission to HCPSS Pre-K will be mailed, with instructions for next steps. Eligible students may have to wait for placement, which is dependent upon available space at the start of the school year.</p>
