  <h1>Applying for Early Admission to Kindergarten</h1>

<section class="callout-border-prim smtb-mg">
<h2>Kindergarten early admission is based on rigorous academic standards</h2>
  <p>The State of Maryland has determined that five years of age is an appropriate age to begin kindergarten. In many cases, children admitted early to school will be working in a setting with older children. To develop a positive perspective about the school experience, children should feel comfortable, competent, and confident as they learn in the classroom setting. Therefore, <strong>only children who meet rigorous admission standards</strong> will be accepted early into the kindergarten program.</p>

  <h2><i class="fa fa-asterisk" aria-hidden="true"></i> Requirements</h2>
  	<p><strong>Age:</strong>  fifth birthday falls between September 2 and October 13</p>

    <h4>Testing and developmental requirements:</h4>
    <p>For early admission in the 2017-2018 school year, the testing period for applicants will <strong>begin March 13, 2017 and conclude May 12, 2017.</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Applicants must be assessed by a certified early childhood educator and receive scores within a specified range.</li>
      <li>Applications require completion of developmental checklists.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>30-day trial period:</h4>
    <ul>
    	<li>Once admitted, a teacher will closely monitor the student's progress for the first month (30 calendar days) at the school they are admitted to. The teacher’s observations <strong>during the trial period serve as the final assessment</strong> of the student's readiness for the program. </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Admission determined by:</strong> Office of Early Childhood Programs</p>

  <h3>Testing Requirement</h3>

  <p>One testing date will be assigned to each applicant. Rescheduling of the testing date will only occur for uncontrollable circumstances (i.e., illness). The date, time, and location of the individualized testing will be mailed to parents/guardians. <strong>The testing results, along with the other application information,</strong> will be used to determine early admission to school.</p>

  <p>Children do not need any type of special preparation for the test. Children who already possess the needed skills will have an opportunity to show them during the assessment.</p>

  <h3>Early Admission Factors</h3>

  <p>The testing results and a child’s prior performance and experience are important to consider as decisions are being made. However, a child’s actual performance in the school’s classroom setting is a necessary part of determining if early admission is in the child’s best interest.</p>

  <p>Therefore, if a child is admitted to school, the teacher will closely monitor the child’s progress for the first month (30 calendar days) of school. The teacher’s observations of the child’s classroom performance during the trial period serve as the final assessment of the child’s readiness for the program. </p>
</div>

<div class="col-right">
  <h3>Notification of Decision</h3>
  <p>Parents/guardians will be notified by letter from the Office of Early Childhood Programs regarding the decision of acceptance or denial for early admission. These letters will be mailed in May.</p>

  <h3>Admission Disclaimer</h3>

  <p>Early admission does not guarantee that the child will be promoted to the next grade. Decisions regarding promotion of early admission kindergartners to first grade will be based on performance during the kindergarten year.</p>

  <p>Applicants denied early admission to kindergarten <strong>will not automatically be placed in HCPSS Pre-K.</strong></p>
